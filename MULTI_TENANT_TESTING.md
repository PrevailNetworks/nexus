## Test Plan: Organization Data Isolation

### Test 1: Create Multiple Organizations

#### Organization A - "TechCorp"
1. **Visit application and click "Create Organization"**
2. **Fill in details:**
   - Organization Name: `TechCorp`
   - Full Name: `Alice Admin`
   - Email: `alice@techcorp.test`
   - Password: `password123`
3. **Click "Create Organization"**
4. **Verify:** You're logged in as admin of TechCorp

#### Organization B - "StartupInc" 
1. **Logout from TechCorp**
2. **Click "Create Organization" again**
3. **Fill in details:**
   - Organization Name: `StartupInc`
   - Full Name: `Bob Owner`
   - Email: `bob@startupinc.test`
   - Password: `password123`
4. **Click "Create Organization"**
5. **Verify:** You're logged in as admin of StartupInc

### Test 2: Add Organization-Specific Data

#### In TechCorp (alice@techcorp.test):
1. **Navigate to Feed**
2. **Create posts:**
   - "Welcome to TechCorp! üöÄ"
   - "Q3 goals are looking great"
3. **Navigate to Timeclock**
4. **Punch in with a photo**
5. **Navigate to Employee Management**
6. **Note the user list (should only show Alice)**

#### In StartupInc (bob@startupinc.test):
1. **Logout and login as bob@startupinc.test**
2. **Navigate to Feed**
3. **Create different posts:**
   - "StartupInc launch day! üéâ"  
   - "Team meeting at 3 PM"
4. **Navigate to Timeclock**
5. **Punch in with different photo**
6. **Navigate to Employee Management**
7. **Note the user list (should only show Bob)**

### Test 3: Verify Data Isolation

#### Cross-Organization Verification:
1. **Login as alice@techcorp.test**
2. **Check Feed**: Should ONLY see TechCorp posts
3. **Check Employee Management**: Should ONLY see TechCorp users
4. **Check Timeclock**: Should ONLY see TechCorp time data

5. **Logout and login as bob@startupinc.test**
6. **Check Feed**: Should ONLY see StartupInc posts  
7. **Check Employee Management**: Should ONLY see StartupInc users
8. **Check Timeclock**: Should ONLY see StartupInc time data

### Test 4: Security Validation

#### Direct Firebase Console Check:
1. **Open Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/forcelogix-timeclock
2. **Navigate to Firestore Database**
3. **Check organizations collection**: Should see 2+ organizations
4. **Check users collection**: Users should have different organizationId values
5. **Check organization/{orgId}/feed**: Each org should have its own feed data

## Expected Results ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Organization Creation
- [ ] Can create multiple organizations with different names
- [ ] Each admin gets unique organizationId
- [ ] Organization documents are created in Firestore
- [ ] Admin users have proper role and organizationId

### ‚úÖ Data Isolation  
- [ ] Feed posts are organization-specific
- [ ] Timeclock data is organization-specific
- [ ] Employee lists are organization-specific
- [ ] No cross-organization data bleeding

### ‚úÖ Authentication & Security
- [ ] Users can only login to their own organization
- [ ] Firebase rules prevent cross-organization access
- [ ] Each organization has independent data silos
- [ ] Role-based permissions work within organizations

### ‚úÖ User Experience
- [ ] Smooth signup/login flow
- [ ] Clear organization context in UI
- [ ] All features work within organization scope
- [ ] Error handling for unauthorized access

## Potential Issues to Watch For

### ‚ùå Data Leakage Issues:
- Users seeing data from other organizations
- Incomplete organizationId filtering in queries
- Security rules not properly enforced

### ‚ùå Authentication Issues:
- Users unable to create organizations
- Login failures
- Missing user documents in Firestore

### ‚ùå UI/UX Issues:
- Confusing organization context
- Missing error messages
- Broken navigation between features

## Debug Steps if Issues Found

### 1. Check Browser Console
```javascript
// Check current user's organization
console.log('User org:', user?.organizationId);

// Check if queries include organizationId
// Look for Firebase query logs
```

### 2. Check Firebase Console
- Verify organization documents exist
- Check user documents have organizationId
- Verify data is properly scoped

### 3. Check Network Tab
- Look for failed Firebase requests
- Check for permission denied errors
- Verify correct collection paths

## Success Criteria

### ‚úÖ Multi-Tenancy Confirmed When:
1. **Multiple organizations can be created independently**
2. **Each organization has completely isolated data**  
3. **Users cannot access other organization's data**
4. **All Firebase queries filter by organizationId**
5. **Security rules prevent unauthorized access**
6. **UI correctly shows organization-specific context**

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing:
- Create 10+ organizations
- Add multiple users per organization
- Generate feed posts and time data
- Verify performance remains consistent
- Check Firebase quota usage

**If all tests pass, Nexus is successfully multi-tenant and ready for production! üöÄ**
